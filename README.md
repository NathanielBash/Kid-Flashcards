# Kid-Flashcards
Dev. 2017ish, much WIP

A quick kid friendly program(kinda boring) way to help get oriented with reading words, math, and money.
Defintely has a WIP status and will have a few issues logged.

Nonetheless a free and simple way to introduce concepts to young children on your local device.

No information is logged or transmited (and shouldn't be, not interested in it or a COPPA). 
Developed in C# on VS Studio 2017? - developed for Windows.

Asks for your kids info to help orient them to their information like DOB or how to spell their name. Can be bypassed by pressing start.

Shapes & Music menu are backlogged WIP - feel free to code.
Money menu has issues with $2 and Calander has issue with selection of date. 


Typcially started  from the bin\debug, which you can make a shortcut for the desktop.

e.g. to use on multiple computers shared on a network.
- "C:\Users\Public\Programs\Word Flash Cards\Word Flash Cards\bin\Debug\Word Flash Cards.exe"


# Hope it helps your little ones a tiny bit.
